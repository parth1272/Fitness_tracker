Set your Nutritionix account credentials (USERNAME, PASSWORD) and other necessary endpoints as environment variables.
Run the Script:

Input the exercises you performed when prompted.
The script fetches exercise details from Nutritionix API and logs them into a Google Sheet.
Google Sheets Authentication:
